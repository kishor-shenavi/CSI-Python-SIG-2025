Part A â€“ Lists

    1. List Operations:
        Create a list of 6 integers.
        Replace the 2nd element with 100
        Append two elements
        Remove the first even number
        Print the updated list and its length.

    2. Sorting & Unique Values:
        Combine two lists [4, 2, 8, 4] and [6, 2, 9], remove duplicates, and print the sorted list in descending order.

    3. Slicing Practice:
        From a list of fruits, print:
        First three fruits
        Every second fruit
        The reversed list using slicing.

    4.List Comprehension:
    Given [3, 6, 9, 12, 15], create a new list containing square of numbers greater than 8 using list comprehension.


Part B â€“ Tuples

    1. Tuple Creation & Access:
        Create a tuple of your 5 favorite songs.
            Print the first and last song.
            Try changing one element and note what happens in a comment.

    2. Tuple Unpacking:
        Given person = ("Kishor", 20, "CS"), unpack and print in the format:
        "Kishor from CS is 20 years old."

    3. Tuple Operations:
        Given t1 = (2, 4, 6) and t2 = (8, 10), concatenate them, repeat twice, and check if 4 and 9 are present.

    4.Conversion Practice:
        Convert a list [1, 2, 3] into a tuple and a tuple (4, 5, 6) into a list, then print both.

Part C â€“ Sets (4 Questions)

    1. Set Operations:
        Create sets A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}.
        Print their Union, Intersection, and Difference (Aâ€“B).

    2. Removing Duplicates:
        Convert list [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 1] into a set to remove duplicates, and print both list length and set length.

    3. Set Membership:
        Given numbers = {10, 20, 30}, check if 40 exists.
            If not, add it.
            Then remove 10.
            Print the updated set.

    4. Frozen Set:
        Create a normal set and a frozenset from [1, 2, 3].
        Try adding an element to both and note what happens.

Part D â€“ Dictionaries (4 Questions)

    1. Basic Dictionary:
        Create a dictionary for a student: name, roll, and branch.
        Print all keys and values using a loop.

    2. Update & Delete:
        From student = {"name": "Amit", "age": 20, "branch": "CS"},
            Update age to 21
            Add "city": "Pune"
            Delete "branch"
            Print the result.

    3. Dictionary of Lists:
        Create a dictionary where keys are subjects ("Math", "CS") and values are lists of marks.
        Print the average marks for each subject.

    4. Nested Dictionary:
        Create a nested dictionary of 2 students (name, age, branch).
        Print the second studentâ€™s name and both branches.
